1. What is AI-ops?
Artificial intelligence for IT operations is abbreviated as AIOps. It refers to multi-layered technology platforms that use 
analytics and machine learning to automate and improve IT operations (ML). Big data is used by AIOps systems, which collect 
data from a range of IT operations tools and devices in order to automatically detect and respond to issues in real time while 
also giving traditional historical analytics.

2. Why do we use Ai-ops?
Data from across the IT ecosystem is ingested, including both historical and real-time streaming data. Filters out the noise, 
allowing only the most important facts to be examined. Patterns in the data are discovered and understood. When possible problems 
are recognised, it sends out notifications or events.
Apart from continuous integration and continuous development, AIOps also provide the model retraining approach.
